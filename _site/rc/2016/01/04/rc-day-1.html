She suggested breaking it down into smaller, more self-contained projects that I could do to learn about the fields that the visualizer would require (i.e. one project for 3D graphics, one project for audio analysis). She also pointed me towards a book called &quot;The Nature of Code&quot;, which may have some interesting chapters about generative art in it.</li></ul><h2 id="what-i-will-do-tomorrow">What I will do tomorrow</h2><ul><li>Talk to Jesse about audio/signal analysis resources</li><li>Talk to Drew about 3D graphics resources</li><li>Come up with some straightforward, short projects that I could do to learn about signal processing</li><li>Think about some generative art projects that I could use to learn about 3D graphics</li><li>Research interesting algorithms that could be used for generative art</li><li>Move this blog to blog.orenshoham.com</li><li>Start reading &quot;Math And Music: Harmonious Connections&quot;, a book that Dave handed me after I discussed my project with him</li><li>Start reading &quot;The Nature of Code&quot;</li></ul></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
