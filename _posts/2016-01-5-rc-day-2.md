Day 2! Today I learned a lot about what WebGL is and how it works by working through [WebGL Fundamentals](http://webglfundamentals.org), and by talking through some questions with Andrew D. This should hopefully set me up well for working with Three.js down the road. I also met my half-sister for the first time, which took up a few hours of productivity in the afternoon.


## Some Important WebGL Terms

**Clipspace:** The 2D coordinate space that WebGL draws on. Coordinates range from -1.0 to 1.0.

**Vertex Shader:** A function that maps 2D or 3D points to clipspace vertices (4D vectors made up of 3D points and an additional value `w` used for clipping).

**Rasterization:** The process of mapping 3D points or clipspace vertices to 2D pixels.

**Fragment Shader:** A function that assigns colors to 2D pixels.

**GLSL:** A C-like language used to write shaders.

## How Drawing With WebGL Works (Roughly)

**Note:** Most of this is cribbed almost verbatim from WebGL Fundamentals. I'm just restating it for my own understanding.

1. 2D/3D points describing a shape or object are passed to the vertex shader.
   In WebGL, you use buffers to pass values into your shaders. As an example, we'll pass an array of 2D points representing 2 triangles into an _attribute_ called `a_position`. WebGL seems to involve a lot of global state, which feels really clunky to me, but anyway here's how you do it:

    ```javascript
    function setGeometry (gl) {
      // look up the memory location where the vertex data will need to go
      var positionLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(someShaderProgram, "a_position");
      var buffer = gl.createBuffer();

      // load floats representing two triangles into the buffer
      gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);
      gl.bufferData(
        gl.ARRAY_BUFFER,
        new Float32Array([-1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0,  1.0, -1.0,  1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0,  1.0])
        gl.STATIC_DRAW
      );

      // enable getting data out of a buffer for this attribute/memory location
      gl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionLocation);

      var numComponents = 2; // we are drawing 2 triangles, so we have 2 components
      var type = gl.FLOAT; // this is presumably used to determine how many bytes each element in the buffer takes up
      var normalize = false; // don't normalize the values (we don't need to worry about what this means right now)
      var offset = 0; // start reading from the beginning of the buffer
      var stride = 0; // how many bytes to move forward by to get to the next vertex
                      // 0 = the correct stride for type and numComponents

      // load the floats into the "a_position" attribute
      gl.vertexAttribPointer(positionLocation, numComponents, type, normalize, offset, stride);
    }
    ```

2. The GPU uses the _vertex shader_ to determine how to map the points into clipspace.
   A simple vertex shader that just maps 2D coordinates directly to clipspace vertices might look like this (note the `a_position` attribute from earlier):

    ```glsl
    attribute vec2 a_position;

    void main() {
      gl_Position = vec4(a_position, 0, 1);
    }
    ```

    `gl_Position` is a special variable whose value is used by the GPU to determine the clipspace value for the current vertex.

3. Assuming that the GPU is drawing `TRIANGLES` (and not `QUADS`), each time that the GPU generates 3 clipspace vertices, it will
   connect them together to form a triangle (if the GPU is drawing `QUADS`, it would presumbly connect 4 vertices to form a square). The GPU then _rasterizes_ the triangle (i.e. draws it with pixels).

4. The GPU passes each pixel to the _fragment shader_, which determines which color the pixel should get. Here's a simple
   fragment shader that colors every pixel green:

    ```glsl
    void main() {
      // the first three values are RGB values, so vec4(0, 1, 0, 1) = green
      gl_FragColor = vec4(0, 1, 0, 1);
    }
    ```

As you can probably tell, working in WebGL is more than a little tedious. However, I think it's important for me to understand how it works before I move on to higher level abstractions like Three.js that are built on top of it.

## What I Will Do Tomorrow

- Continue working through WebGL Fundamentals
- Start reading "Foundations of 3D Computer Graphics"
