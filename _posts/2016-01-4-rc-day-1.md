So, this is the first in what will hopefully be a series of daily blog posts chronicling my time at RC. My intention is to use this blog as a means of tracking what I've done each day, and what I intend to do the next. This is entirely for my own personal benefit - I doubt anyone but me will ever read this. Here goes!

## What I did today

  - Met a whole bunch of people
  - Set up this blog (currently under my GitHub pages domain, but soon to be moved to blog.orenshoham.com)
  - Discussed how to approach my first project (a browser-based music visualizer) with Allie, one of the RC facilitators.
    She suggested breaking it down into smaller, more self-contained projects that I could do to learn about the fields that the visualizer would require (i.e. one project for 3D graphics, one project for audio analysis).
    She also pointed me towards a book called "The Nature of Code", which may have some interesting chapters about generative art in it.

## What I will do tomorrow

  - Talk to Jesse about audio/signal analysis resources
  - Talk to Drew about 3D graphics resources
  - Come up with some straightforward, short projects that I could do to learn about signal processing
  - Think about some generative art projects that I could use to learn about 3D graphics
  - Research interesting algorithms that could be used for generative art
  - Move this blog to blog.orenshoham.com
  - Start reading "Math And Music: Harmonious Connections", a book that Dave handed me after I discussed my project with him
  - Start reading "The Nature of Code"
