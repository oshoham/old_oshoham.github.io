Today I got a little stuck. I feel like I have a reasonable grasp on how WebGL works, but I've also realized that making cool things in WebGL requires a lot of code and a lot of math. Drawing complex shapes by defining arrays of floating point numbers is a huge pain!

The main reason for this is that WebGL isn't really a 3D graphics engine. WebGL gives you the tools to render 3D objects, should you so desire, but you have to tell it how to do that. You have to specify the geometry that you want to render, how it should be colored, and any transformations you want to make to the geometry that you're rendering, all by hand in terms of vectors and matrices.

For example, if you want your scene to be viewed from a camera with depth perspective, you have to write a bunch of  matrix transformations to translate, rotate, and selectively resize the objects that you're rendering in order to create the visual illusion of a camera facing your objects from a certain angle). Defining complex scenes from scratch takes a ton of code.

**Note:** If you're interested in a more coherent explanation of what I'm talking about here, read [this](http://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-2d-vs-3d-library.html).

However, there is a library out there called [TWGL.js](http://twgljs.org/), whose "sole purpose is to make using the WebGL API less verbose", so maybe I'll check that out and use it to create a few demos before I move on to Three.js. I'd like to have some actual code to show for my efforts by the end of tomorrow.

## What I Did Today
- Read through the rest of WebGL fundamentals
- Spent a lot of time looking at [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com)
- Got my mind blown by the work of [Inigo Quilez](http://www.iquilezles.org/prods/index.htm)
- Stared off into space for a while thinking about matrix math
- Gained a rough understanding of:
  - how 3D objects can be rendered via WebGL
  - how the illusion of perspective is created mathematically in a 3D scene
  - how to animate via Javascript in a framerate-independent way via `requestAnimationFrame`
  - how to apply textures to 3D objects in WebGL
  - how to structure WebGL code in a (reasonably) sane way
  - what a scene graph is

## What I Will Do Tomorrow
- Create at least one interesting WebGL demo
- Think about interesting concepts for 3D music visualization
- Research fractals and other algorithms that could be used for generative art
- Start learning Three.js (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/three/intro/ and http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webgl/shaders/)
- Maybe take a look at this [NYU graphics course](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/courses/fall2015/)
